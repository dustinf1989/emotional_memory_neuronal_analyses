# emotional_memory_neuronal_analyses

This folder contains all of the code and spike train data required to generate all of the main and supplementary figures.

Enter the code folder and run the script 'spike_analysis_final.m' to generate all example neuron plots
(Fig. 1), Fig. 2, SFig. 1, SFig. 2 and SFig. 3. 

The only thing you need to change are the code_folder and data_folder variables based on where you save the folder locally.

Enter the dPCA_DF folder and run 'iapsEncoding_dpcaPipeline_final=.m' to generate Fig. 3 and the encoding (left) part of SFig. 4
- Again, the only thing you need to change are the code_folder and data_folder variables based on where you save the folder locally.

Run 'iapsRecognition_dpcaPipeline_final=.m' to generate Fig. 4 and the recognition (right) part of SFig. 4.
