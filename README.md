# emotional_memory_neuronal_analyses

This folder contains all of the code and spike train data required to generate all of the main and supplementary figures of the manuscript entitled "Neuronal population representation of human emotional memory"

Download the dataset from [G-Node](https://gin.g-node.org/dfetterhoff/emotional_memory_neuronal_data) to run the code

In each script, you only need to change the code_folder and data_folder variables based on where you save the data folder and this repository.

Run the 'behavior_analysis.m' script to generate the behavioral statistics and Tables S1 and S2.

Run the script 'spike_analysis_final.m' to generate all example neuron plots (Fig. 1), Fig. 2, SFig. 1, SFig. 2 and SFig. 3. 

Run 'iapsEncoding_dpcaPipeline_final.m' to generate Fig. 3 and the encoding (left) part of SFig. 4

Run 'iapsRecognition_dpcaPipeline_final.m' to generate Fig. 4 and the recognition (right) part of SFig. 4.
